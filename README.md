üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Docker Desktop must be installed and running on your machine.

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/himanshusingh9554/ecommerce.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd ecommerce
(Note: If you named the folder something else, cd into that folder.)

Create the Environment File:
Create a file named .env in the root directory and paste the following line into it. This is required for creating secure login tokens.

**JWT_SECRET=this_is_a_very_secret_key_and_should_be_long**


Build and run the application:

Bash

docker compose up --build
The server will start and be available at http://localhost:3000.

**Seeding the Database (Important for Testing)**
To create the default admin user and sample products, you need to run the database seeder.

Make sure the application is running (after docker compose up).

Open a new terminal window.

Run the following command:

Bash

**docker compose exec app npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all**

Running Natively (Without Docker)
Prerequisites:

Node.js (v18 or later)

PostgreSQL installed and running.

Instructions:

Clone and install dependencies:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/himanshusingh9554/ecommerce.git
cd ecommerce
npm install
Create the Database:
Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running. Open a SQL shell (psql) and create the database.

SQL

CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;
Create the Environment File:
Create a file named .env in the root directory. You must update the user and password to match your local PostgreSQL setup.

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=this_is_a_very_secret_key_and_should_be_long

# Database Connection
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_local_postgres_password
DB_NAME=ecommerce
Seed the Database (for Testing):
Run the seeder command to populate the database with a default admin user and products.

Bash

npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
Start the Server:

Bash

npm start
The server will start at http://localhost:3000.
